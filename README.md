# fprettydb

fprettydb is a fpclib powered tool to fix and get metadata for Flashpoint's curations. The basic usage is to move Flashpoint's sqlite to the script's folder and run `dbfix.py`.

Most site definitions including fpcurator.py are shortened from [fpcurator](https://github.com/FlashpointProject/fpcurator).
